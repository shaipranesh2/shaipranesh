            <h3>Week 1</h3>
            <p>
              This week, I explored how to work with HPC - like creating a
              custom conda environment. It is important to note that working
              with HPC posed a unique challenge, as it did not grant me the
              customary sudo access that I had grown accustomed to in other
              computing environments. Overcoming this obstacle proved to be a
              stimulating exercise, requiring resourcefulness and creative
              problem-solving skills. . Then figured out how to work with slurm
              and have programs run on GPU. Also, I contacted the previous year
              contributor to same project - Shrey Pandit (PS: we are from the
              same university!) and clarified a few doubts about the model. So,
              from next week on, my mentors ssaid they will give me access to
              the dataset

            <h3>Week 2</h3>
            <p>
              This week I got access to dataset and went through the dataset's
              general type. It conisted of videos in .mp4 format and was under
              the folder with the label names. So my plan to utilize this data
              after talking with my mentors was to have bash script which should
              automize the pipleine end-to-end and should be uploaded on github.
              And seeing the STGCN graphs medium blog post- I got a plan on how
              the input features be. The input features should be in a numpy
              array of (batch, channels, frames, joint number,person) Also,
              before this all, the openpose keyposes should be extracted and
              used. Thus I installed Openpose and made a custom python script to
              extract poses per frame of each video and output it to the same
              folder structure as the input videos are in.

              I completed the script but got it only working on my personal
              computer as I could not install Openpose on the HPC. Now I tried
              looking for resources and my mentors said in the meet that we need
              singularity container to use it on HPC, and he said he is gonna
              reach out to some other members who can provide already extracted
              and improved dataset. Then I installed singularity and openpose
              using this{" "}

              , which was written by a previous GSoC contributor of the same
              organization. But I found some inconsistencies with the steps, but
              then eventually figured out a way to use openpose with
              singularity! Then proceeeded to extract all the features framewise

            <h3>Week 4</h3>
            <p>
              Using the extracted keypose points in json file format, I
              programmed a python script to extract the keypose point
              coordinates and score, then used them to construct a numpy array
              with the previously agreed format and saved them all in a .npy
              file per single video. Furthermore, I created a Dataset class
              using pytorch, and loaded and tested it successfully! Upon the
              further discussion with my mentors, who asked me to explaing the
              STGCN model in detail, they agreed it can be effective way and
              they said a better dataset will be provide to me next week, which
              I should utilize it. A bit about STGCN: Spatio Temporal Graph
              convolutional network or STGCN in short, expploits the graph
              structure of the skeloton poses to classify them. STGCNs have 2
              major components - the spatial convolution and the temporal one.
              The spatial convolution takes in the feature of K nearest
              neighbours(in our case 1) on the same temporal frame, and passes
              it down to a linear layer. This spatial model also has different
              partion scheme where it partitions the nearest K neighbours into
              different classes based on a heurestic decide (which mostly
              invovles the distance from the center of the body), and then uses
              the same weights for the same classes. Then across the temporal
              domain, a temporal kernel size is to be decided and uses the
              feauter of nodes along the T temporal domain but the same spatial
              domain. Then at the end, a softmax classifier is used to predict
              the probaibility of the classes that the gesture belongs to. It
              also uses a mask layer which gives in the weightage or importance
              of each node before passing onto the network. PS: I also read some
              literature which stated STGCN includes only short term features
              and are best suitable for it and for long term features, fusion
              can be performed to combine STGCN and lstm network.

            <h3>Week 5</h3>
            <p>
              I took a look at the new improved dataset which had all the
              relevant keypose points in csv file and modified the json-to-npy
              script to make it work with csv. And upon further looking at this
              dataset, I found class imbalance like one label had 2 samples, but
              some had like 130! Then I thought to utilize transfer learning
              from the original STGCN, but found they used a different openpose
              structure which only had 18 points compared to the 25 body
              keyposes this dataset uses, which should be resolved....
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="GsocWeekDiv">
            <h3>Week 6</h3>
            <p>
              I utilized the STGCN model and modified it for using 25 keypose
              points, and then made the classses one hot vector to be used. Then
              split the training and testing dataset randomly and used a
              crossentropyloss, and a adam classifier. But the results, were not
              good.... I got only a training and testing accuracy of a mere 5%.
              Upon the investigation on the dataset I found the dataset to be
              unbalanced, with some classes having 2 videos and while some
              having more than 100 video examples! So, I tried using weights to
              the crossentropyloss which gives different weightage to different
              classes, so by this my idea was to make the classes with most
              videos to have more weightage and have more penalty in return, but
              I found this approach only increased the accuracy to about 8%.
              Then I resorted to use oversampling, which after 30 epochs, I got
              a training accuracy of about 94% and testing accuracy of about
              80%!!! I may have dealt with the imbalance but the model seems to
              be overfitting and I will use techniques like SMOTE(Synthetic
              Minority Oversampling Technique) and custom augmentation on
              keypose points (I could not find any good paper or example on the
              internet for augmentation on direct keypose points). So my idea
              would for the custom augmentation to use inversion about the
              vertical axis(as the gesture performed should be hand or direction
              invariant), and will introudce gaussian noise to nudge the keypose
              points a litte from their original postion and will use randomly
              drop or 1 or 2 keypose points. Also, I did not use batching due to
              different frames in each video, which made the training slower. I
              plan to make the frames uniform by oversampling frames and
              inserting them.

            <h3>Week 7</h3>
            <p>
              After the meet with my mentor, I decided to implement the changes
              as asked. I failed to see how oversampling can be a great issue
              here!! So, I went on to create a Stratified Split technique which
              is in scikit learn and use it to split train and test. Stratified
              splitting technique, splits the classes with large amount of
              samples in the ratio specified and the smaller ones (typically
              about 2-10 in size) in a 50-50 manner for test and train. I
              implemented these changes. Also, I implemented a zero padding
              function which pads the keypose graph with 0s making the graph
              size equal, and allows for batching, leaving the model to learn
              the zeros are actually padding and not any significant value. But
              sadly, after following stratified split, I did not get the test
              scores I got previously and it was very low like about 2-3%.
              Thanks to my mentor for rightly pointing out, and my training
              score was about 80%, and clearly my model was overfitting here.

            <h3>Week 8</h3>
            <p>
              This week, I started researching some ways to reduce overfitting,
              I tried L2 regularisation and dropout. Also, I limited the classes
              to the ones which are having more than 20 samples. But
              unfortunately, I got the same results with test score at ~3%. :(
              And I could not work mostly due to heavy rains and prolonged
              powercut in the region I live in. But have ideas to implement an
              embeddding layer which differentiates the STGCN in a space and
              classifies them.

            <h3>Week 9</h3>
            <p>
              This week I implemented cosine simalrity loss to create an
              embedddingl layer for the model. Also, decreased the complexity of
              the model by reducing the input features restricting them to face
              and hand body keypose points and decreasing the model layer size.
              I tried out with different learning rates, at first 10 epochs, the
              model's train and test scores gradually rise to about 7-8% and
              loss slowly decreases, but after 10 epochs the training score
              increases rapidly with no change from test scores, making the
              model overfit again. :( I tried using L2 regularisation and found
              both training and testing to be close in accuracy and in loss
              terms, but did not get it to bothe increase beyond a point.... I
              have attached the training and testing logs in the repo along with
              the accuracy matrix. Will try to further optimize the parameters
              or try with the old GSoC data and see the results.
